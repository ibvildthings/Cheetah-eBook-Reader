# 🐆 Cheetah Reader

**Built for readers who want to finish books.**

Not browse them. Not collect them. Finish them.

Read faster. Focus better.

**Read at the speed of thought.**

Drop an EPUB. Start reading. No logins, no sync, no friction.

## Why Cheetah?

Most ebook readers are built for machines. Cheetah is built for your brain.

- **Flow Mode** – Your eyes follow the text. Adjustable speed (100-650 WPM).
- **ADHD-Friendly** – Fonts designed for focus: OpenDyslexic, Lexend, and more.
- **Zero Friction** – No accounts. No cloud. Just drag, drop, and read.
- **13 Themes** – From Sepia to Matrix Green. Dark mode that doesn't hurt.
